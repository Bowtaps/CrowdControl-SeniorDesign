\chapter{Design  and Implementation}
This section is used to describe the design details for each of the major components 
in the system.    Note that this chapter is critical for all tracks.  Research tracks would do experimental design here where other tracks would include the engineering design aspects.    This section is not brief and requires the necessary detail that 
can be used by the reader to truly understand the architecture and implementation 
details without having to dig into the code.    Sample algorithm:  Algorithm~\ref{alg1}.  This algorithm environment is automatically placed - meaning it floats.   You don't have to worry about placement or numbering.  

\begin{algorithm} [tbh]                     % enter the algorithm environment
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}          % give the algorithm a caption
\label{alg1}                           % and a label for \ref{} commands later in the document
\begin{algorithmic}                    % enter the algorithmic environment
    \REQUIRE $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
    \ENSURE $y = x^n$
    \STATE $y \Leftarrow 1$
    \IF{$n < 0$}
        \STATE $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \STATE $N \Leftarrow -n$
    \ELSE
        \STATE $X \Leftarrow x$
        \STATE $N \Leftarrow n$
    \ENDIF
    \WHILE{$N \neq 0$}
        \IF{$N$ is even}
            \STATE $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \STATE $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \ELSE[$N$ is odd]
            \STATE $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \STATE $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \ENDIF
    \ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Citations look like~\cite{Choset:2005:PRM, arkin2009governing, lavalle2006}  and~\cite{wiki:asimo,lumelsky:1987, nolfi2000evolutionary}.  These are done automatically.  Just fill in the database {\tt designrefs.bib} using the same field structure as the other entries.  Then pdflatex the document, bibtex the document and pdflatex twice again.  The first pdflatex creates requests for bibliography entries.
The bibtex extracts and formats the requested entries.  The next pdflatex puts them in order and assigns labels.  The final pdflatex replaces references in the text with the assigned labels.
The bibliography is automatically constructed.  
 

\section{Major Component \#1 }

\subsection{Technologies  Used}
This section provides a list of technologies used for this component.  The details 
for the technologies have already been provided in the Overview section. 

\subsection{Component  Overview}
This section can take the form of a list of features. 

\subsection{Phase Overview}
This is an extension of the Phase Overview above, but specific to this component. 
 It is meant to be basically a brief list with space for marking the phase status. 

\subsection{ Architecture  Diagram}
It is important to build and maintain an architecture diagram.  However, it may 
be that a component is best described visually with a data flow diagram.

\subsection{Design Details}
This is where the details are presented and may contain subsections.   Here is an example code listing:
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 10
/* Block
 * comment */
 
int main()
{
    int i;
 
    // Line comment.
    puts("Hello world!");
 
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        puts("LaTeX is also great for programmers!");
    }
 
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
This code listing is not floating or automatically numbered.  If you want auto-numbering, but it in the algorithm environment (not algorithmic however) shown above.
