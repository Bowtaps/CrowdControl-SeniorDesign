\chapter{User Stories, Backlog and Requirements}
\section{Overview}


The overview should take the form of an executive summary.  Give the reader a feel 
for the purpose of the document, what is contained in the document, and an idea 
of the purpose for the system or product. 

 The userstories 
are provided by the stakeholders.  You will create he backlogs and the requirements, and document here.  
This chapter should contain 
details about each of the requirements and how the requirements are or will be 
satisfied in the design and implementation of the system.

Below:   list, describe, and define the requirements in this chapter.  
There could be any number of sub-sections to help provide the necessary level of 
detail. 





\subsection{Scope}


What scope does this document cover?  This document would contain stakeholder information, 
initial user stories, requirements, proof of concept results, and various research 
task results. 



\subsection{Purpose of the System}
The purpose of Crowd Control is the ease the user expearence of going out in groups.


\section{ Stakeholder Information}


This section would provide the basic description of all of the stakeholders for 
the project.  Who has an interest in the successful and/or unsuccessful completion 
of this project? 


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will this person or group manage 
and prioritize the product backlog?  Who will they interact with on the team to 
drive product backlog priorities if not done directly? 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will the Scrum Master drive the 
Sprint Meetings? 


\subsection{Investors}
Are there any?  Who?  What role will they play? 


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
Who?  Is there a defined project manager, developer, tester, designer, architect, 
etc.? 


\section{Business Need}
Use this section to define what business need exist and how this software will 
meet and/or exceed that business need.   

\section{Requirements and Design Constraints}
Use this section to discuss what requirements exist that deal with meeting the 
business need.  These requirements might equate to design constraints which can 
take the form of system, network, and/or user constraints.  Examples:  Windows 
Server only, iOS only, slow network constraints, or no offline, local storage capabilities. 


\subsection{System  Requirements}
What are they?  How will they impact the potential design?  Are there alternatives? 


\subsection{Network Requirements}
Network requrements are mobile networks as this is a mobile applications. The requirement on our part is making sure that the application is able to reach the server and use at little data as possible when connected to the network. Making sure we use as little data as possible will help our users not use all of their data. 


\subsection{Development Environment Requirements}
The development enviroment requirement is that Crowd Control be avalabe on both iOS and Android platforms. Being cross platform allows for us to reach as many users as possible.


\subsection{Project  Management Methodology}
The stakeholders might restrict how the project implementation will be managed. 
 There may be constraints on when design meetings will take place.  There might 
be restrictions on how often progress reports need to be provided and to whom. 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item What system will be used to keep track of the backlogs and sprint status?
\item Will all parties have access to the Sprint and Product Backlogs?
\item How many Sprints will encompass this particular project?
\item The sprint cycles are 3 weeks long.
\item Are there restrictions on source control? 
\end{itemize}

\section{User Stories}
This section can really be seen as the guts of the document.  This section should 
be the result of discussions with the stakeholders with regard to the actual functional 
requirements of the software.  It is the user stories that will be used in the 
work breakdown structure to build tasks to fill the product backlog for implementation 
through the sprints.

This section should contain sub-sections to define and potentially provide a breakdown 
of larger user stories into smaller user stories. 



\subsection{User Story \#1 }
As a user i want to be able to join a group.

\subsubsection{User Story \#1 Breakdown}
Does the first user story need some division into smaller, consumable parts by 
the reader?  This does not need to go to the level of actual task definition and 
may not be required. 

\subsection{User Story \#2} 
As a user i want the abilitiy to track locations of 

\subsubsection{User Story \#2 Breakdown}
User story \#2  .... 

\subsection{User Story \#3} 

\subsubsection{User Story \#3 Breakdown}
As a user i want post agenda for the group. \#3  .... 

\subsection{User Story \#4} 
As a user i want to i want the abilitiy to look for local groups
\subsection{User Story \#5} 
As a user i want the ability to have suggestions of local activities.
\subsection{User Story \#6} 
\subsection{User Story \#7} 
\subsection{User Story \#8} 
\subsection{User Story \#9}
\subsection{User Story \#10}  

\section{Research or Proof of Concept Results}
This section is reserved for the discussion centered on any research that needed 
to take place before full system design.  The research efforts may have led to 
the need to actually provide a proof of concept for approval by the stakeholders. 
 The proof of concept might even go to the extent of a user interface design or 
mockups. 


\section{Supporting Material}


This document might contain references or supporting material which should be documented 
and discussed  either here if appropriate or more often in the appendices at the end.  This material may have been provided by the stakeholders  
or it may be material garnered from research tasks.
