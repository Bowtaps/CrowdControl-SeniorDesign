\section{Project  Management Approach}
This section will provide an explanation of the basic approach to managing the 
project.  Typically, this would detail how the project will be managed through 
a given Agile methodology.  The sprint length (i.e. 2 weeks) and product backlog 
ownership and location (ex. Trello) are examples of what will be discussed.  An 
overview of the system used to track sprint tasks, bug or trouble tickets, and 
user stories would be warranted. 


\section{Phase  Overview}


If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
 This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
revision. 

\section{Terminology and Acronyms}
Provide a list of terms used in the document that warrant definition.  Consider 
industry or domain specific terms and acronyms as well as system specific.
