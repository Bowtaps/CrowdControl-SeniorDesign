\section{Team Member's Roles}
Each team member plays a pivitol role in the development of Crowd Control.  Listed below are each members and their corresponding responsibilities within the production of Crowd Control.  Some of the duties of each member changed half way through production as development of iOS was halted for more progress on Android.  The entire projects duties are outlined below for each individual developer.  

Johnathan Ackerman - Johnathan is leading the front end design and messaging implementation for the Android version of Crowd Control. This entails: 
	\begin {enumerate}
	\item Creating and designing GUI elements for android
	\item Designing messaging Layout
	\item Implementing logic behind group join, group info, and messaging views for Android
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Project  Management Approach}

Crowd Control was developed using the Agile software development method.  The project was split up into 7 sprints each lasting 3 weeks.  For the first 4 sprints, each sprint was planned out with goals for each sprint.  The last 3 sprints had plans for each week, creating goals for all of the weeks inside of the sprints.  To track sprint goals, meeting minutes were used to define each members goals at the beginning of each sprint.  Another way to track goals and bugs along the way was to use the GitHub Issue tracker, each issue contained data about the feature or bug and any questions or extra data necessary.  All of this was wrapped up in scrum meetings five days a week.  Scrum meetings are stand-up meetings usually lasting five to ten minutes were each member would report on what they had accomplished, what they were working on next, and if there were any issues holding back progress.


\section{ Stakeholder Information}
The stakeholders of this project were the members of Bowtaps LLC.  These five members were the same five members developing Crowd Control, their names are listed above in section 3.1.


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will this person or group manage 
and prioritize the product backlog?  Who will they interact with on the team to 
drive product backlog priorities if not done directly? 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
For Crowd Control, Bowtaps chose to make Daniel Andrus the scrum master. His duties included helping guide scrum meetings and helping to break up features into week long goals.


\subsection{Investors}
Currently Bowtaps has not sought out investment from external sources, instead the members developing Crowd Control have done so using funding from other sources.  To fund the development of Crowd Control the team has entered into a few competitions with their intellectual property to help generate funds.   The team has competed in the South Dakota Governor's Giant Vision, The Innovation Expo, and the Mines CEO Business Plan competitions to gain capitol to cover their current costs.


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
For the term of our development each member of the team was a developer and a tester.  This meant that before a member of the team merged their code from their branch to a main branch that they would go through and thoroughly test.

\section{Budget}
Describe the budget for the project including gifted equipment and salaries for 
people on the project.

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
The intellectual property Crowd Control is owned by Bowtaps LLC which is currently made up of the team currently developing Crowd Control.  All source code, documentation and presentation materials are protected by copyright.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
 This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
revision. 

All of the Agile decisions are listed here.  For example, how do you order your backlog?   
Did you use planning poker?

\section{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 
To develop Crowd Control the team used a few different products to develop, test, and run.  For development of Crowd Control for Android, the team used the Android Studio IDE which supports all aspects of Android development.  Using Android Studio's Layout Editor to help create the GUI, and using its built in support for Java to code the controller and model layers. The Android Studio download online comes with all of the necessary products to build, run, and test Crowd Control. The iOS development all took place on XCode, an Apple Development IDE, much like Android Studio XCode contains a layout editor and all of the necessary build scripts to build, run, and test the iOS version of Crowd Control.  For the back end of development, the team chose to use parse and created two databases on the platform.  One database for development and one for deployment.  Both databases are wrapped by the app so there is little trouble to switch the code when time for deployment.

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Describe which IDE and provide links to installs and/or reference material. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[Android]
	Android Studio - http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
\item[iOS]
	XCode - Xcode can be found on the Apple App Store for free
\item[Parse]
	Parse Accounts can be obtained at parse.com
\end{itemize}

\section{Source Control}
To manage source control of Crowd Control, Bowtaps is currently using Git, and the server is hosted by GitHub.

\section{Build Environment}
To build Crowd Control there is little difference on the developers end between Android and iOS.  On the Android side, Android Studio uses a build environment called Gradle that builds and compiles the source code and packages it into an apk.  However for the developer, little has to be done besides running the Gradle scripts to receive an apk.  The only thing to note on the Android build phases would be that there must be a match between the Java Version used for building and compilation and the SDK version.  This correlation can be found online as new SDK release and as new Java versions are available.  On the iOS side there is even less management necessary. For iOS, XCode manages all of the building and compiling of the Swift code.  Only at the beginning of a project or upon the choice to update the lowest supported version of iOS are changes necessary to the build settings.  However, if needed these settings can be accessed in XCode under the build settings tab.  

\section{Development Machine Setup}
To develop Crowd Control for iOS or Android on an Apple device, such as a MacBook or other Apple Product, the only setup required is to download the IDEs necessary.  On the windows side however it should be noted that after installing the Android Studio IDE depending on the type of physical device used for testing, there may be necessary driver downloads to interface with Android Studio's built in ADB(Android Debug Bridge).  These drivers can be found online either from the manufacturer of the mobile device or some can be found on third party sites depending on the phone.
