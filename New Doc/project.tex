\section{Team Member's Roles}
Each team member plays a pivitol role in the development of Crowd Control.  Listed below are each members and their corresponding responsibilities within the production of Crowd Control.  Some of the duties of each member changed half way through production as development of iOS was halted for more progress on Android.  The entire projects duties are outlined below for each individual developer.  

Johnathan Ackerman - Johnathan is leading the front end design and messaging implementation for the Android version of Crowd Control. This entails: 
	\begin {enumerate}

\section{Project  Management Approach}
This section will provide an explanation of the basic approach to managing the 
project.  Typically, this would detail how the project will be managed through 
a given Agile methodology.  The sprint length (i.e. 2 weeks) and product backlog 
ownership and location (ex. Trello) are examples of what will be discussed.  An 
overview of the system used to track sprint tasks, bug or trouble tickets, and 
user stories would be warranted. 

Crowd Control was developed using the Agile software development method.  The project was split up into 7 sprints each lasting 3 weeks.  For the first 4 sprints, each sprint was planned out with goals for each sprint.  The last 3 sprints had plans for each week, creating goals for all of the weeks inside of the sprints.  To track sprint goals, meeting minutes were used to define each members goals at the beginning of each sprint.


\section{ Stakeholder Information}


This section would provide the basic description of all of the stakeholders for 
the project.  Who has an interest in the successful and/or unsuccessful completion 
of this project? 


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will this person or group manage 
and prioritize the product backlog?  Who will they interact with on the team to 
drive product backlog priorities if not done directly? 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will the Scrum Master drive the 
Sprint Meetings? 


\subsection{Investors}
Currently Bowtaps has not sought out investment from external sources, instead the members developing Crowd Control have done so using funding from other sources.  To fund the development of Crowd Control the team has entered into a few competitions with their intellectual property to help generate funds.   The team has competed in the South Dakota Governor's Giant Vision, The Innovation Expo, and the Mines CEO Business Plan competitions to gain capitol to cover their current costs.


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
Who?  Is there a defined project manager, developer, tester, designer, architect, 
etc.? 

\section{Budget}
Describe the budget for the project including gifted equipment and salaries for 
people on the project.

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
The intellectual property Crowd Control is owned by Bowtaps LLC which is currently made up of the team currently developing Crowd Control.  All source code, documentation and presentation materials are protected by copyright.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
 This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
revision. 

All of the Agile decisions are listed here.  For example, how do you order your backlog?   
Did you use planning poker?

\section{Development Environment}
The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 
To develop Crowd Control the team used a few differetn products to develop, test, and run.  For development of Crowd Control for Android, the team used the Android Studio IDE which supports all aspects of Android development.  Using Android Studio's Layout Editor to help create the GUI, and using its built in support for Java to code the controller and model layers.  The iOS development all took place on XCode, an Apple Development IDE, much like Android Studio

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Describe which IDE and provide links to installs and/or reference material. 

\section{Source  Control}
Which source control system is/was used?  How was it setup?  How does a developer 
connect to it? 

\section{Dependencies}
Describe all dependencies associated with developing the system. 

\section{Build  Environment}
How are the packages built?  Are there build scripts? 

\section{Development Machine Setup}
If warranted, provide a list of steps and details associated with setting up a 
machine for use by a developer.
