\section{Mission Statement}
Our mission at Bowtaps is to develop innovative mobile software applications to provide solutions to inconveniences that trouble the everyday user. With our software, we plan on changing the mobile environment by creating applications that are easy to use with  intuitive interfaces and reliable services for everyday use.  

\section{Elevator Pitch}

Our company, Bowtaps, is developing an iPhone/Android app to help young adults and event-goers stay in contact with friends while in loud and crowded places using group messaging and GPS features.
\newline\newline
Our product, Crowd Control, is designed to become an essential element for groups looking to go out together by providing both powerful group-management tools and interesting nearby outing suggestions, such as local events, concerts, and pub crawls.
\newline\newline
We will work with local businesses and event planners to sponsor these suggestions. This will generate content for our users, visibility for our sponsors, and revenue for ourselves.
\newline \newline
We plan to release the app for free in early-to-mid summer of 2016.
