\section*{Team Details}
Here are some auxiliary details about our workflow and division of responsibilities, during the sprint: \\\\

Dan and Johnny started off Sprint 4 by working on messaging-related features, while Joe and Evan worked on GPS and map features. Nick focused on the business plan, updating the existing documentation to use the updated layout, and was tasked with installing the Fabric SDK.\\

For week two of the sprint, Johnny focused on group messaging. Dan and Nick also worked together on cloud code, targeting the leaving/joining groups, and a group update service in Android. Evan wrote a LocationManager class and stubbed out methods, that Joe wrote an interface for and made a UI for in the MapFragment.\\

Week three continued with Joe and Evan working on various location features, while Dan and Johnny worked on the update service and messaging features respectively. Nick focused on cloud code and business plan/documentation writing.\\

Additionally, this was the first sprint in which we had Dan serve as acting Scrum Master, to aid in organization and appointment of responsibilities. Though he did officially take this role on during our Winter Sprint (Sprint 3.5), most of us were either working remotely or unavailable, thus we were unable to fully utilize this new organizational change until now.
