\section*{Team Details}
Here are some auxiliary details about our work-flow and division of responsibilities, during the sprint: \\\\

The team focused heavily the first week on the Business Plan.\\

For week two of the sprint, very little was accomplished due to other programs\\

Week three: Johnny was able to get many little things in the app to display better, such as more information on the group page. Joe put a lot of work into the theme and got custom pictures displaying in the tabs bar for groups. Evan got the map to function properly with syncing. Dan was able to finally fix the messaging bug.\\

(TODO) I know that nick got a bunch of cloud code working with Dan, but I do not know when.
