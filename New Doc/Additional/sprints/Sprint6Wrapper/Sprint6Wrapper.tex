\section*{Team Details}
Here are some auxiliary details about our work-flow and division of responsibilities, during the sprint: \\\\

During the first week, Dan got messaging loading conversations for groups, and Johnny made the interface more friendly by adding the names of who sent a message. Evan and Joe worked out a better way to atomatically send location updates.\\

During week two, Johnny made menu's acceptable site wide after log in, as well as finishing up leader commands after Dan solved the leader load issue. \\

Week three: The team went to the Giant Vision competition. Crowd Contol did not make a top 5 spot but got exposure to the public from around South Dakota. We also got to see people's opinion about Crowd Control during the demo's as well as getting people to sign up for the beta. \\
