  abstract = {With a highly applied and computational focus, this book combines
	the important underlying theory with examples from electrical engineering,
	computer science, physics, biology and economics. An expanded list
	of computer codes in an appendix and more computer-solvable exercises
	in the text reflect Strang?s interest in computational linear algebra.
	Many exercises appear in the sections and in the chapter reviews.
	Exercises are simple but instructive.},
