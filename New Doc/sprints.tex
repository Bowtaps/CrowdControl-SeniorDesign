\section{Sprint Report \#1}
The sprint reports should be inserted here.     Reports focus on process.  Design elements can be inserted into the design chapter with the report discussing the design element in more of an overview fashion.   If you write your sprint reports in \LaTeX\ it will be easier to include.
