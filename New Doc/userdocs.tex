\subsection{iOS}
\subsubsection{AppStore}

Apple Appstore version is not currently avalable.

\subsubsection{XCode}

\textbf{Launching Your App on a Device}


It takes just a few steps to launch your app on a device if you previously created your code signing identity and team provisioning profile, as described in Creating the Team Provisioning Profile. Otherwise, a series of dialogs and warnings may appear as Xcode resolves the code signing issues in the process of launching your app.\\


\textbf{To launch an app on a device}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect the device to your Mac.
\item In the project navigator, choose your device from the Scheme toolbar menu.\\ Xcode assumes you intend to use the selected device for development and automatically registers it for you.\\

	\caption{iOS Device selection \label{iOSDeviceSelection}}
	\end{figure}
	
 If your device is disabled in the Scheme toolbar menu because it is ineligible, fix the issue before continuing. Under Ineligible Devices, hover the mouse over the device to read the reason why itâ€™s ineligible. For example, if the OS version is lower than the deployment target, upgrade the OS version on the device or choose the version you want to target from the Deployment Target pop-up menu (located in the Deployment Info section). Then select the device from the Scheme toolbar menu.
\item If a prompt appears asking whether codesign can sign the app using a key in your keychain, click Always Allow.
\item Click the Run button.\\

Xcode installs the app on the device before launching the app.
