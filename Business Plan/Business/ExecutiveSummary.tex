\chapter{Executive Summary}

Bowtaps is a software development company focused on technological innovation. We aim to provide mobile solutions that alleviate the stresses of modern life. Our passionate and experienced developers strive to create products that will change the way users go about their daily lives.\\

Our flagship product is Crowd Control, a mobile application designed to ease the experience of going out. Crowd Control will accomplish this through integrated group messaging, GPS mapping, and group status updates. It will provide users with a reliable and easy way to track their friends and fellow users at events of any kind, while providing local businesses a platform to showcase their venue.\\
 
Currently there is nothing on the market that meets the same set of needs that we are targetting. As we will detail later on, other existing services only implement one key aspect of our app whereas Crowd Control brings all of these core features together into a single product.\\
 
Our initial market entry plan is to keep the app free to download in order to lower the barrier of entry for users. Sponsored ads, or “suggestions”, will be our primary revenue source. Suggestions are a way to give users ideas for possible events for their group to attend in their area.\\

Ad space will be priced based on the population of users in the area. Since this price is essentially demand-driven, advertisement prices will be calculated based on user growth in the area. It is important to note that our advertisements are not traditional banner ads; rather, they are sponsored event suggestions made available to users that are searching for events in their area. We believe this is especially attractive to users as it is unobtrusive while adding value and content. Advertisers would also benefit from our unique approach to advertising as it would entice more impressions from users.\\

In the app market, the entry into the marketplace is crucial, especially as a start-up company. Currently, without other released products to generate revenue, it is important that user base grow as quickly as possible. A strong entry into the marketplace will help fuel further development and allow us to expand Crowd Control with additional features. Targetting local high-traffic events as our beachhead markets will aid in early growth and provide us the insight needed to plan expansion to new markets.\\

As our user base dictates our finances, our goal is to minimize development costs up until the launch of Crowd Control. To accomplish this, all backend services we utilize implement a scalable pricing plan that is free for low usage amounts. As our usage exceeds one million unique server requests per month, costs will increase and must be maintained in the release phase. Additionally, Crowd Control was programmed in such a way that, if needed, we can transition away from our current back-end services with relative ease.
