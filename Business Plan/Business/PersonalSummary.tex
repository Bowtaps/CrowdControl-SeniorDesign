\chapter{Personal Summary}

\section{Personnel Plan}

As our team consists solely of developers, we are able to evenly split tasks to one another, depending on necessary feature sets and other constraints that may come up in the product’s development and testing phases.

In effort to keep investment costs low, each of the five developers in Bowtaps has elected to not take a wage that exceeds our revenue flow. This, of course, means that no wages will be taken for the entirety of the product’s development and pre-release, and possibly for a time into the full release phase.\\
