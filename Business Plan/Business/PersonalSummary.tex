\chapter{Personnel Summary}

\section{Personnel Plan}

As our team consists solely of developers, we are able to evenly divide tasks amongst one another depending on necessary feature sets and other constraints that may come up in the product’s development and testing phases.

In an effort to keep investment costs low, each of the five developers in Bowtaps has elected to not take a wage that exceeds our revenue flow. This, of course, means that no wages will be taken for the entirety of the product’s development and pre-release, and possibly for a time into the full release phase.\\

\section{Future Personnel Expansion}
Our future expansion plans consist of exploring the talent avalable from the South Dakota School of Mines \& Technology. Bowtaps plans on attending SDSM\&T career fairs to search for both intern and full-time employees. Additionally, we plan on utilizing the Dakota Seeds program to help fund early intern possibilities.

As our company grows, we plan to make use of the students here in South Dakota to build fantastic apps while furthering their education. By establishing a strong market presence, we will be in a unique position to bolster South Dakota's place in the technology sector. We look forward to expanding Bowtaps with the talent found at SDSM\&T and schools throughout the region.
